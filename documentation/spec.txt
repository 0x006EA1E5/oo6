! OTHERobjects 6

!! Introduction

OTHERobjects is a Java based Content Management System. It is built on top of (and integrates tightly with) the Grails web application framework which itself is based on the proven combination of Hibernate and Spring.

There may be some companion projects:

* OTHERcommerce: an ecommerce framework
* OTHERclicks: an email marketing plugin
* OTHERintelligence: data-collection and reporting framework

Almost all modern public facing websites are a delicate balance of CMS managed data and web-app behaviour. Whilst there are dozens of app frameworks and many CMS systems there is no combined solution that strikes the correct balance. Until now.
