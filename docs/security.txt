Security
--------

Requirements

* Security checks should be based on fine-grained permissions (eg Add Article)
* Roles confer a group of permissions (eg Editor)
* Groups define a scope within which a Role is valid (eg International News)
* A User is assigned a Role sometimes within a Group

* Secured pages always accessed over https (redirect if required)
* Session id changed after authentication

Examples

ALICE is a EDITOR of INTERNATIONAL_NEWS
BOB is a CONTRIBUTOR of DOMESTIC_NEWS

EDITOR has permissions APROVE_ARTICLE, REJECT_ARTICLE, CREATE_ARTICLE
CONTRIBUTOR has permissions CREATE_ARTICLE, UPDATE_ARTICLE






Users
* username (usually email but not always)
* password (not always...)
