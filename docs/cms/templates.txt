Templates
---------

Pages are assembled from templates. 

Layouts define the struture of the page (2-col, 3-col etc.)
Blocks  define an are of the page (header, advert, main content etc.)

A Template consists of a Layout template and an arrangement of Block Templates.

Using templates
---------------

Each template is designed for one or more primary site objects.

By default the template with the same name as the object is used. For example,
when rendering an Article object, the template name Article is used.

Templates can be overridden in the following places:

* Per folder (and descendents)
* Per object
* Per link (is this a good idea?)
