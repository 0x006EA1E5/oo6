Navigation Services
-------------------

Four types of site area:

1. JCR defined (eg folders and articles)
2. JDBC defined (eg categories and products)
3. Workflow defined (eg checkout, my-account, surveys)
4. Externally defined outside scope (third party forum)

Navigation requirements

* URL to resource
* Resource to URL (if allowed)
* SSL enforcement
* Site map: nav elements inc breadcumbs

Design considerations

* Performance - whole site map could be HUGE eg virgin books 
* Retain hierarchical path based design
* Spring handle URL to Resource nicely but not site map generation
* Resource movement
* Redirects
* Analytics

Solution 1

* All OO managed resources have an entry in JCR
* Even processes like checkout
* Lazy-loaded and cached for performance
* Anything 'special' is done via Spring but loose the linking and sitemap features
* Option to plug in alternate providers at set points
