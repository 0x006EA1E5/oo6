      <title>Who is this guide for?</title>

      <para>This guide is for developers who want to extend the capabilites of
      OTHERobjects beyond what is possible via the web interface and third
      party plugins. You'll need this guide if you want to:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create custom site components</para>
        </listitem>

      <para>If you are just interested in building a standard website then you
      should read the Site Builder Guide instead. If you're not sure then you
      should start off with the Site Builder Guide and come back here when you

    <title>Getting ready</title>

    <section id="section-how-to-set-up">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>OTHERobjects in a pure Java project based on the Spring framework
      and build with Maven. If you are an experienced Java developer you will
      probably have your own preferences for an IDE. build process and app
      server. In this case just skip ahead to the next section.</para>

      <para>However, if you're fairly new to Java or want a setup that will
      work with the minimum of fuss then this section will help you get your
      environment set up.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Supported platforms</title>

      <para>OTHERobjects should run well on any platform that supports Java
      5.0. This includes Apple Mac OS X 10.4+, Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista
      and most distributions of Linux.</para>

      <para>Although, OTHERobjects runs on Windows it is happiest on UNIX-like
      systems such an Mac OS X and Linux. Windown users may need to install
      CygWin.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="section-configuring-your-documentation">
      <title>Installing required software</title>

      <para>There is some key software that you will need before you can start
      developing with OTHERobjects.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Java</title>

        <para>You will need a JVM installed and version 5.0 is required. If
        your system does not come with a JVM installed we would recomment the
        latest Sun JDK from java.sun.com/download. Check that your JVM is
        installed:</para>

        <programlisting>brushed:~ rich$ java -version java version
"1.5.0_07" Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard
Edition (build 1.5.0_07-164) Java HotSpot(TM) Client
VM (build 1.5.0_07-87, mixed mode, sharing)

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Apache Maven</title>

        <para>Next you'll need Apache Maven version 2.0.7 or greater. You can
        dowload it from: <uri>http://maven.apache.org/download.html</uri> .
        Once you have donwloaded and installed Maven you should make sure that
        the <emphasis role="bold">mvn</emphasis> command is included in your
        path:</para>

        <para><programlisting>brushed:~ rich$ mvn -version

</programlisting> ImageMagick</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>ImageMagick</title>

        <para>We use ImageMagick for high quality image resizing. You need
        version 6.3 or later. Download a binary package from <uri>
        http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php </uri> and
        install it. You will need to set your paths and environment variables
        correctly. To test that you have the correct version is installed run
        the followin command:</para>

        <para><programlisting>brushed:~ rich$ convert -version Version:

      <section>
        <title>Eclipse</title>

        <para>Finally you will need an IDE. We recommend Eclipse 3.3. Download
        <emphasis>Eclipse for JEE Developers</emphasis> from
        http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.</para>

        <para>Once this is installed you should add the following plugins via
        the Update Manager:</para>

        <para>See http://open.ncsu.edu/se/tutorials/install_plugin/ for a
        instructions on installing plugins.</para>

        <para>There are other plugins that you wish to add later but for now
        these essential ones will do.</para>

        <para>You should now launch Eclipse and check that your plugins are
        installed via the About Eclipse Platform menu option.</para>

        <para>This guide assumes a basic knowledge of Eclipse. A good short
        tutorial on using Eclipse is available at
        http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2004/cmsc131/EclipseTutorial/.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Checking out the source code</title>

      <para>The next step is to check out the soucres code to OTHERobjects and
      to the sample project that we will use throughout the rest of this
      guide.</para>

      <para>First of all switch to the SVN Repository Exploring and create a
      new Repository Location. OTHERobjects and the sample project are located
      at:</para>

      <programlisting>svn+ssh://svn.otherworks.com/data/svn/repos-ng
</programlisting>

      <para>You will be able to connect anonymously since you will not be
      checking changes to the repository.</para>

      <important>
        <para>OTHERobjects develops will need to authorise with their private
        key when creating the repository.</para>
      </important>
