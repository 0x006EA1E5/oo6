    <title>What we want to do</title>

    <para>We would like to release OTHERobjects and the rest on our software
    stack (including OTHERcommerce and OTHERclicks) as open-source software.
    Other users will be able to download the software and use it to build
    websites.</para>

    <para>The biggest danger facing an open-source project in irrelevance. By
    providing a high quality and complete Java based software stack we think
    we could get a fair sized community relatively quickly. Key to that though
    is releasing unique and useful software.</para>

    <para>Whilst there are a few other open source Java CMS systems they lack
    polish. There are only a couple of open source Java eCommerce systems and
    they are not widely adopted. This presents us with an excellent
    opportunity to make a bit impact in the open-source java space.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Why we should do it</title>

    <para>Open-sourcing a project effectively gives it away for free. It is
    this idea that makes many people uneasy about the idea of open-sourcing a
    project that has taken many years and many thousands of pounds to develop.
    This section outlines some of the benefits that come from having an
    open-source project.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Excellent publicity</title>

      <para>This gives a real story to shout about. It will increase our
      profile in the industry and make potential clients aware of us.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Technical reputation</title>

      <para>Currently we have no real technical reputation. By creating and
      championing an open source project we could gain a reputation as a very
      strong development shop. It puts us ahead of the curve -- no other
      agencies are doing this.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Feedback and ideas from external users</title>

      <para>By making OO available for others to use we will receive feedback
      from them. They will bring new ideas and new ways of building sites that
      we won't have thought of.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Feedback from experienced programmers</title>

      <para>There are almost certainly much better ways of doing some of the
      things we have done. As an open source project we would receive feedback
      and advice from other experienced programmers.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Our work done by external developers</title>

      <para>Other users of OO will report problems and ask for new features.
      Some of them will fix the problems and build the features themselves,
      saving us time and effort. If other developers adopt OO seriously they
      may contribute significant amounts of useful code -- in effect sharing
      the development costs.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Feedback from associated projects</title>

      <para>The other projects that we use in OTHERobjects (Hibernate,
      Velocity) have considerable experience integrating with projects like
      OTHERobjects. By making our code open source we can show them how we
      have approached the problem and get their feedback.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Better access to developers of associated projects</title>

      <para>There are times when we would like changes made to associated
      projects. As an open source project we would stand a much better chance
      of having our opinions heard and acted on.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Incentive to write better code and documentation</title>

      <para>Developing code with the knowledge that it will be seen by others
      encourages you to question, justify and document your decisions. The
      result is better, more secure and more maintainable code.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Vulnerabilities can be discovered, reported and fixed</title>

      <para>Peer review is the standard methodology for security related
      projects. Other developers will be able to check our code and notify us
      of any security issues.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Better for education</title>

      <para>If the code is open source it is much easier to use it in articles
      and lectures. Students or readers can download OO, see how it works and
      start using it. They could choose to base projects around it, providing
      us with another pool of developers.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Finding employees</title>

      <para>Our standard no-thank-you letter to job applicants should contain
      an invitation to get involved with the OO project. Those who do get
      involved and produce good code could be employed at a later date. Good
      developers may also be drawn to us by OO project making it easier to
      recruit.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Finding freelancers</title>

      <para>With a closed source CMS only our developers will know how to use
      it. Anyone who starts using our open-source CMS becomes a potential
      freelancer who can help us out during busy periods.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Higher profile for our developers</title>

      <para>Designers have their work on constant display but developers work
      is hidden. Open source is an opportunity for the OTHER media to show off
      the quality of its technical team.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Reassure clients who are worried about lock-in</title>

      <para>A common concern from larger clients is that they are locked in to
      our proprietary CMS. Using an open-source CMS (especially one with a
      growing user base) will alleviate these fears.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>People who adopt OO become potential clients</title>

      <para>Organisations who start using OO for their sites will eventually
      need new features for their sites. The natural supplier services to
      these companies will be the OTHER media.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Clients who understand open source will like us more</title>

      <para>Those clients who understand open source (and that includes large
      corporations and governments) will know why we have chosen to open
      source our code and like us for it.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Clients who have technical knowledge will respect us more</title>

      <para>Larger clients will have technical employees who will be able to
      see the scale and quality of what we have developed.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Access to commercial development tools at no cost</title>

      <para>Several development tools vendors provide free licenses to
      open-source projects. Examples include Yourkit Profiler (which makes it
      easy to find performance bottlenecks), Clover (which measures how much
      of your code is excised in tests) and Fisheye (which provides detailed
      information about the source code repository). To purchase these tools
      would cost thousands of dollars.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>It makes us more attractive to investors</title>

      <para>Open source is a major part of many new companies. Being the owner
      of a widely used open source project makes us a much more interesting
      company to potential investors.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Give back some of what we're taking</title>

      <para>OO wouldn't have be possible without open source. We are now
      completely dependent on other open source projects. Since we have gained
      so much from open source we have a moral duty to give back in some
      way.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Why we should think carefully about this</title>

    <para>Some reasons against open-sourcing our software:</para>

    <section>
      <title>Explaining to clients why our software is free</title>

      <para>We are already charging them for a lot of free stuff: Linux,
      Apache, Java, postgres, velocity, hibernate. OO would represent a tiny
      fraction of the free code we are using. And the majority of our clients
      are not paying for OO anyway.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Hackers can spot vulnerabilities in the code and exploit
      them</title>

      <para>By making out code available developers can spot the weaknesses.
      Instead of reporting them they may choose to exploit them. However, the
      general consensus in the security community is that hackers will find
      the weaknesses anyway and that it is better to have the code open so
      that people can help find and fix the weakness. We should also consider
      a third-party security audit before the initial release.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Competing agencies may use OTHERobjects (and pitch against
      us)</title>

      <para>If this is a concern we should always inform clients that we have
      an open source CMS that we have developed and that other agencies are
      free to use it. If we demo our system it will be pretty obvious if
      another company is using a rebranded version of our CMS. And in this
      situation we would have a considerable technical advantage as the
      creators not just the users of the CMS. A more likely scenario is that
      other agencies use our CMS for projects that we don't pitch for and
      develop new and useful plugins for us.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Licensing options</title>

    <para>One of the most important factors influcencing the success of an
    open source project is the license chosen. It is the license that
    determines who will be able to use the project, for what purposes and
    under what restrictions.</para>

    <section>
      <title>License types</title>

      <para>We can choose to either create a new license from scratch, modify
      and existing license or use a general purpose license. The Open Source
      Initiative keeps a list of approved open source licenses and it is
      important for both community-acceptance and marketing that whichever
      license we use is OSI approved. There was a brief fashion for "vanity"
      licenses where a company would take an exsting general purpose license,
      modify it slightly and the name it after themselves (for example the
      Mozilla Public License, Lucent Public License) but the needless
      proliferatino of these has caused the OSI to stop approving such
      licenses.</para>

      <para>The most obvious choice is therefore to chose from one of the
      widely known and used general purpose licenses of which there are 2 main
      types:</para>

      <section>
        <title>Apache/BSD/MIT Licenses</title>

        <para>“You are free to use this code however you want.”</para>

        <para>This is arguably the most “open” open source projects. All the
        open source components included in OO5 are licensed under this type of
        license which allows us to resell OO without restrictions. A BSD
        licensed project can be used in any commercial project with no
        restrictions.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>GNU Public License</title>

        <para>“If you use this code in your project, then you must also
        open-source your project”</para>

        <para>This license effectively prevents the code being used in
        commercial products. Whilst there in nothing in the license that
        specifically prevents the code being modified and sold as a product,
        if this does happen then the code of the commercial product would be
        required to be open source, thus allowing others to distribute it free
        of charge. As a consequence of this, any enhancements made by third
        parties to our code would need to be released publicly and we could
        incorporate them into future versions. </para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Future licensing options</title>

      <para>As the copyright holder (see next section) to all the code we
      would have the option of changing the licensing policy at some point in
      the future time. For example, we could offer an unrestricted commercial
      license that would allow other companies to use our code in their
      projects. We would also have the right to stop releasing OO as
      open-source. However, past releases would always remain open. We should
      also be aware that any license changes may upset any community that
      grows around the project.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Copyright and trademark issues</title>

    <para>We recommend that the copyright to all the code in OTHERobjects is
    owned by the OTHER media (or OTHERworks?). All contributors to the code
    base would be asked to assign the copyright of their code over to the
    OTHER media.</para>

    <para>The trademarks for the name (and logos) for OTHERobjects would
    continue to be held by the OTHER media. We would have the right to
    restrict their usage if we so wished. See
    http://www.ubuntu.com/aboutus/trademarkpolicy for an example of how
    another project does this.</para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>The Process</title>

    <para>Releasing and running a successfull open-source project will require
    some addition work. A rough overview of the process is described
    here.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Legal preparation</title>

      <para>The first step is to choose a license (we recommend GPLv2) and the
      copyright holder (either OTHERmedia or OTHERworks).</para>

      <para>We should check that any name and artwork we wish to protect are
      appropriately trademarked. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Naming decisions</title>

      <para>The natural name for our new version of OTHERobjects is
      OTHERobjects 6.0. However, the open-source world tends to be slightly
      suspicisous of mature proprietary projects becoming open-source. We
      should be releasing a version 1.0 project that can grow with the
      community.</para>

      <para>We also need to carefully consider how other projects will be
      named. What is the overall brand. OTHERworks? OTHERobjects?</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Code review</title>

      <para>We need to check that:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We are the copyright holder of all the code and have the right
          to release it</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The files contain appropriate copyright and license
          information</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The files are properly documented</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The tests are complete and have good coverage</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>There are tools to help with this task and we estimate that it
      will take approximately 2 weeks.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Documentation</title>

      <para>A major stumbling block in the adoption of open source projects is
      the lack of quality documentation. We intend to publish 4 manuals to
      accompany the first release of OTHERobjects:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>User Guide (for users of the CMS such as our clients)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Site Builder Guide (for advanced users to build and extend
          their site without using Java)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Dveloper Guide (for developers looking to build advnced sites,
          write plugins or work on OTHERobjects)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Hosting Guide (for administrators hosting in more complex
          setups than the default embedded mode)</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>This documentatino is in progress and will probably require 4-6
      weeks more work.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Project support services</title>

      <para>We'll need to provide several key services to support the
      project:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>SVN Source Code Repository Server</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Source code browser</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Issue tracker</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Mailing list</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Some of these may be outsourced to other sites (for example Google
      Code could host our SVN repository) and we will make decisions about
      this nearer the time.</para>

      <para>We will require at least one server and about one week of setup
      time.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Website</title>

      <para>A great CMS is going to need a great self-hosted website. Key
      features should be:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Project downloads</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Online documentation</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Forums</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Demo videos</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Plugin directory</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The site will take around 3-4 weeks to build.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Ongoing community support</title>

      <para>Community support involves:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Monitoring forums and mailing lists and bug reports</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Providing technical help</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Responding to reporting on other sites</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It is hard to tell how much time this may take and will largely
      depend on the size of the community that grows around otherobjects. A
      good first estimate would be about one day per week.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Marketing</title>

      <para>A larger community creates a larger pool of people able to improve
      OTHERobjects. Once the project is somewhat established and initial
      feedback has been taken into account we should start to market our
      project more widely.</para>

      <para>This may take 1-2 days a month.</para>
    </section>
  </chapter>

  <chapter>
    <title>Conclusions</title>

    <para>The open-sourcing of OTHERobjects will likely be the most
    significant event for the OTHER media in 2008. It has the potential to
    change the way we both work and think as a company and hopefully we will
    soon start to see the benefits.</para>
