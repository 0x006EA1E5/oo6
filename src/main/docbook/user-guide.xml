      <title>Who is this guide for?</title>

      <para>This guide is for developers who want to extend the capabilities
      of OTHERobjects beyond what is possible via the web interface and third
      party plugins. You'll need this guide if you want to:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create custom site components</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Develop your own plugins</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Update and improve OTHERobjects itself</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you are just interested in building a standard website then you
      should read the Site Builder Guide instead. If you're not sure then you
      should start off with that simpler guide and come back here when you
      need to.</para>

    <title>Getting ready</title>

    <para>OTHERobjects in a pure-Java project based on the Spring framework
    and built with Apache Maven. If you are an experienced Java developer you
    will probably have your own preferences for an IDE, build process and app
    server. In this case just skip ahead to the next chapter.</para>

    <para>However, if you're fairly new to Java (or just want a setup that
    will work with the minimum of fuss) then this section will help you get
    your working environment prepared.</para>
