    <title>Where does the data go?</title>

    <para>OTHERobjects sites use Maven under the hood to manage a variety of
    build functions. The standard maven directory layout
    (http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)
    is quite deep and unnecessray for most OO projects. Our standard layout is
    described below:</para>

    <para></para>

    <para> </para>

    <para>As you build you site you will be adding all sorts of code and data.
    It is obviously important to keep this safe.</para>

    <para>Templates and type definitions</para>

    <para>Assets: JS, CSS, graphics</para>

    <para>Scripts</para>

    <para>Site data: added data, UGC, uploaded files</para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="chapter-overview-of-steps">
    <title>Overview of steps involved to build a site</title>

    <para>There are a couple of steps that you will need to go through each
    tme you build a site with OTHERobjects. We will very briefly go over these
    here to give you an idea of what's involved.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>First you will need to think about the various different types
        (or objects if you are coming from a programming background) you will
        need in your site. Obvious ones that almost all sites will need are
        articles and news items. But there might also be things like jobs,
        events, products, press releases to name but a few.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Then you will need to define those in a file called
        src/main/resources/site.resources/bootstrap-data/jcr-data-types.xml in
        your sites project folder. Have a look at that file and its sibling in
        the OTHERobjects project folder in
        src/main/resources/otherobjects.resources/bootstrap-data/jcr-data-types.xml
        to get a feeling on what that involves. We might add a type designer
        in the wrokbench in the future to do that.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Then log in to the workbench and create the overall folder
        structure of your site (at least the first level).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Then create at least one layout file in
        src/main/resources/site.resources/templates/layouts. Create a
        corresponding entry in the workbench in Designer &gt; Layouts giving
        the filename (without the path) as the content of the 'Code' field. A
        layout is the main document making up your site's html documents. It
        contains the Doctype and HTML head and body sections and controls the
        overall layout of your sites pages (as the name implies). You can have
        as many layout files as you want but it is advisable to keep the
        number down. A useful scheme that has evolved over time is to have one
        layout for the home page, one for the subfolder index listing pages
        and one for all other content pages.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Then create a block for at least one of your types in
        src/main/resources/site.resources/templates/blocks. A block is a mini
        template that controls with what markup the properties of your types
        are inserted into the site pages. It can also contain simple content
        logic, like list the 5 latest news items etc.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Now that you have types and layouts and blocks you can create
        templates (Designer &gt; Templates). A template wires together blocks
        and layouts by specifying which blocks go into which designated
        regions in a layout in what order.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Now when you create any of your types by going to a folder
        listing and choosing 'Add Object' you can choose from the template(s)
        you created and whatever template you choose is then used to view (and
        preview) that type.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <chapter>
    <title>Defining object types</title>

    <para>TypeDef must have: name</para>

    <para>Properties much have: name, type, size?</para>

    <para>Choose a base object ie is it a page or not.</para>

    <para>Conventions: page objects have title, content, summary (for
    elsewhere), image</para>

    <para>Sholud name always end in Page? EventPage?</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>A note about paths</title>

    <para>With resources spread across multiple projects (your site,
    OTHERobjects and your plugins), potentially across multiple servers (a
    static server or external data server) and running in different
    environments (development, staging and production) it can become very
    difficult to handle paths.</para>

    <para>We aim to simplify this by having a single path naming convention
    for all resources which is then resolved to the correct locations.</para>

    <para>What you need from a Resource:</para>

    <para>internalPath -- unique path reference that remains constant</para>

    <para>filePath -- path of the file on disk (if appropriate)</para>

    <para>externalUrl -- externally accessible URL (if appropriate)</para>

    <para>inputStream -- for reading data (guaranteed to always work)</para>

    <para>outputSteram -- for writing data (if appropraite)</para>

    <para>In addition, specfic resources may have their own addtional
    paths.</para>

    <para>Internal path format:</para>

    <para>/module/type/resource.ext</para>

    <para>/site/static/image.png</para>

    <para>/otherobjects/template/header.ftl</para>

    <para>/site/data/uploaded-image-123.jpg</para>

    <para>/plugins/polls/static/graph.png</para>

    <para>Note if the path represents a directory it MUST end with a
    slash.</para>

    <title>Site URL structure</title>

    <para>The site URL structure is crucial to help you users gain a mental
    model of your site hierarchy. You can generally use any folder name but a
    few top level folders are reserved.</para>

    <para>otherobjects -- main interface</para>

    <para>static -- static files when served on local server (reserved even
    when not)</para>

    <para>data -- data files when served locally</para>

    <para>plugins -- reseved for plugins</para>

    <para>debug -- diagnostics information</para>

    <title>Scheduling tasks</title>

    <para>How to create scheduled tasks.</para>

    <para>Currently we support two types of scheduled Jobs:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Jobs written in Java</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Jobs written in Groovy</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Both Job types share the same abstract base class as executor:
    org.otherobjects.cms.scheduler.AbstractSpringQuartzJob whose main purpose
    is to provide some contextual setup extracted from the JobExecutionContext
    and to setup security so as to not run these jobs without any security
    context (remember that these jobs are run asynchronously outside of any
    http reqest scope).</para>

    <para>To create a Java job, write a java class extending above mentioned
    AbstractSpringQuartzJob. In your class you can get access to the root web
    application context by calling getApplicationContext(). Then create a
    Scheduled Job in the scheduler folder in workbench and fill in the fully
    qualified class name in the 'Name of job class' field. The job only gets
    added to the scheduler once you publish it.</para>

    <para>To create a groovy job, follow the same steps aas above but instead
    of filling in the 'Name of job class' field, type or paste your script in
    'Groovy script source' field. The script will have access to the root web
    application context via the 'appCtx' variable.</para>

    <para>The jobs are always run under the security context of the user that
    created them.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Writing tests</title>

    <para>A stable and high-quality website requires thorough testing. All too
    often this testing is on the form "Does this page look sort of right?" or
    "Well It worked for me when I built it so it's OK to go live". Whilst this
    approach will work for very simple sites, as soon as the complexity
    increases there just isn't time to look at every page and try every action
    manually after each change. This in where automated testing comes
    in.</para>

    <para>People who are new to testing often bemoan the amount of time they
    spend writing tests, especially at first when the tools and techniques are
    new and need to be mastered. This, however, is a small price to pay to
    reduce the time spent debugging and fixing broken code. And as the testign
    techniques become more familiar the tests become correspondingly easier to
    write.</para>

    <title>Improving performance</title>

    <para>OTHERobjects uses caching at several levels to keep your site
    peforming well even under heavy loads. However, it is important to
    understand how the caching works in order to get the best performance out
    of it.</para>
